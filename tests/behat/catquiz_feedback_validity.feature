Feature: Feedback output is bound to a valid CAT result.
  As a student I only see per-scale feedback when my attempt produced a valid
  result. When no scale can be reported, I see a single central notice instead
  of scattered "not available" blocks (issue #10).

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                      |
      | student1 | Student1  | Test     | toolgenerator1@example.com |
      | teacher  | Teacher   | Test     | toolgenerator3@example.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname |
      | Course 1 | C1        |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role           |
      | student1 | C1     | student        |
      | teacher  | C1     | editingteacher |
    And the following "local_catquiz > questions" exist:
      | filepath                                                            | filename                               | course |
      | local/catquiz/tests/fixtures/quiz-adaptivetest-Simulation-small.xml | quiz-adaptivetest-Simulation-small.xml | C1     |
    And the following "local_catquiz > importedcatscales" exist:
      | filepath                                          | filename             |
      | local/catquiz/tests/fixtures/simulation_small.csv | simulation_small.csv |
    ## TinyMCE misbehaves in acceptance tests; use a plain editor.
    And the following config values are set as admin:
      | config      | value         |
      | texteditors | atto,textarea |
    And the following "activities" exist:
      | activity     | name             | course | section | idnumber         | intro               |
      | adaptivequiz | My Adaptive Quiz | C1     | 1       | adaptivecatquiz1 | Adaptive Quiz Intro |
    And the following "local_catquiz > testsettings" exist:
      | course | adaptivecatquiz  | catmodel | catscales  | cateststrategy         | catquiz_selectfirstquestion | catquiz_minquestions | catquiz_maxquestions | catquiz_standarderror_min | catquiz_standarderror_max | numberoffeedbackoptions |
      | C1     | adaptivecatquiz1 | catquiz  | Simulation | Infer lowest skill gap | -2                          | 2                    | 4                    | 0.0                       | 1000.0                    | 2                       |
    ## The CAT settings generator creates the initial JSON structure, but the
    ## adaptivequiz integration normalises and reserialises it through the activity
    ## settings form. This is the same setup used by the established multi-question
    ## catscales_attempt_management Behat scenario. Without this round-trip the
    ## adapter can read incomplete settings and finish the attempt after question 1.
    ## Standard-error/test-information stopping is deliberately made non-binding;
    ## maxquestions = 4 therefore determines the end of the attempt.

  Scenario: An invalid attempt shows a single central notice, not per-scale feedback
    ## The "Infer lowest skill gap" strategy declares a fraction of >= 1 (every
    ## answer correct) invalid, because with no wrong answer there is no skill gap
    ## to infer. Answering every question correctly therefore excludes every scale
    ## and no valid result can be determined.

  Scenario: A scale with reporting switched off is not displayed but still finalised
    ## Issue #7: reporting is a DISPLAY decision, statistical validity is not. A
    ## scale whose report checkbox is off must not be shown, yet the attempt is
    ## still finalised normally - it is not turned into an "invalid" attempt, and
    ## the central "no valid result" notice is reserved for real measurement
    ## problems.
